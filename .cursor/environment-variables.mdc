description: Prohibition on working with .env files
alwaysApply: true
---

GENERAL RULE: 

Prohibited reading, creating, modifying, or deleting any files that start with `.env`, including but not limited to:  
- `.env`  
- `.env.local`  
- `.env.development`  
- `.env.production`  
- `.env.test`  
- `.env.*` (any files starting with `.env`, besides the exception mentioned below)

EXCEPTIONS:

Only allowed:
1. Creating a .env.template file with a list of variables is allowed.
2. Checking for the existence of `.env` files using `ls` or `test -f`  
3. Checking access rights to `.env` files using `ls -la`  
3. Providing instructions** to the user on how to work with `.env` files  

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

Instead of directly working with `.env` files, AI agent should:  
1. Provide instructions to the user on creating/modifying files  
2. Suggest commands for the user to execute  
3. Check configuration (e.g., vite.config.ts) for correct handling of environment variables  
4. Explain how to properly set up environment variables for different platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

REASONS:

1. Security: `.env` files contain secret keys, passwords, tokens, and other confidential information  
2. Unpredictability: Automatic modification of `.env` files may lead to loss of important variables  
3. Isolation: Environment variables should be controlled by the developer, not the AI assistant
